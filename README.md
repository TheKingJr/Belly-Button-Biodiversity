# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis Challenge 12

## Overview of Project

The premise of this project was to provide Roza with an interactive dashboard so that each volunteer could visualize their belly button bacterial data. She wanted to present a completed panel with demographic information, horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 bacteria cultures found, bubble chart displaying bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart displaying the belly button washing frequency. This task was achieved using a Javascript data visualization library named Plotly.js, D3.json to fetch and parse external data from the sample.json file, event handlers and javascript functions to filter through the data, and funcational programming in HTMl to present the information on an interactive webpage. Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

- Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart

- Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
